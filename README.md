# procedures

Nevermind. This should be a Youtube series. 

These are boilerplates. Cheatsheets. Either name would have served well for this repository but I added a military spin to it. In the military, everything you do is precise and according to procedure because mistakes can cost lives. In a company, everything you write as a developer impacts many customers and mistakes can cost $$$. So follow strict procedures, PRIVATE! 

To start any new project:
1. Create the repo on Github with a README and MIT license
2. Create the folder on your computer, open VSCode, and drag the folder onto it 
3. In the integrated terminal, `git clone https://github.com/romanjamesmirov/<REPO> .`
4. `npm init`
5. If you'll be using create-react-app, delete the `"homepage": "https://github.com/romanjamesmirov/<REPO>#readme` line from package.json (CRA uses it when building and a "homepage" pointing to a Github will throw an error)
